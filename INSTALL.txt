Please note that build system support for install is not very well
tested, so please be careful.

To install using CMake - set up a cmake project as usual
and use make or ninja install much like for Meson below
which we document in more detail since it is less known.
Also be aware of scripts/post-install-check.sh

See also Build Instructions in README.md.

To install with meson from root of project tree see
scripts/meson-install.sh as a starting point.

The runtime library is (or should be) installed as a static libflatccrt
and a shared library libflatccrt_sha. The compiler library libflatccrt
is installed as either a shared or a dynamic library depending on build
flags. The static library version is really important for efficient
flatbuffer performance as it is designed for whole program static
inlining. Older compilers should use object files instead for the same
reason. While the runtime library versions could have the same name with
different extensions, this is very difficult to use, and currently
impossible on MacOS.

If installing documentation, please be aware that README.md should
be copied together with in content in the doc directory. This is not
part of the build install procedure.

UNINSTALL:

There is a meson-uninstall.sh script that should only be used as a
guideline since it is not tested well, and likely not the system of
choice.

Simplified, the following files are to be removed:

#!/bin/sh
set -e
DESTDIR=/usr/local
rm $DESTDIR/bin/flatcc
rm -rf $DESTDIR/lib/libflatcc*
rm -rf $DESTDIR/include/flatcc/*
rmdir $DESTDIR/include/flatcc

but please be careful and double check things on you system first.
